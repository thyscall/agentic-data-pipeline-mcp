    -- Custom test: verify that the most recent event in the web analytics
    -- staging model is no more than 24 hours old. This is a data freshness
    -- check that works independently of dbt's built-in source freshness.

    -- The test fails (returns a row) if the most recent event_timestamp
    -- is more than 24 hours old.

    -- Students: implement this test. The query should return rows only when
    -- the freshness check FAILS (i.e., when data is stale). If data is
    -- fresh, the query returns zero rows and the test passes.
